				'What makes Glowskins special? Glowskins are a Casing and Diffuser all in one! Place your entire chip inside and create a glow throughout the whole casing! This differs from our Frosted Diffusers which create a glow only around the bulb. There are 3 unique sizes, each designed for Coffin, Nano or Coin chip microlights. Glowskins are made with semi-flexible TPU plastic so your fingers will always feel comfortable! They do not inhibit access to your microlight button for mode switching. Our light and streamline design makes your fingers feel weightless. Smooth finish for easy removal from whites.'
